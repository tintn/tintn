### Welcome to my GIthub! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Tin Nguyen

I'm a Machine Learning (ML)/Deep Learning (DL) Engineer and a Physicist.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently a ML engineer at Firevisor Systems where I'm in charge of both developing detection models and building ML systems on production.
- ðŸŒ± My current interest is MLOps and filling the production gap in ML applications. Personally experienced the pain of getting multiple trained models to production and maintaining them, I believe having a properly designed ML platform can help us mitigate the problems.

To know more about me:
- [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trung-tin-nguyen/)

Want to have a chat?
- I'm always open for interesting conversations. If you are interested in MLOps or machine learning in general, feel free to get in touch!
- I'm best reached via [email](trung.tin.nguyen0309@gmail.com)
