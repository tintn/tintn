### Welcome to my GIthub! 👋

Hi, I'm Tin Nguyen

I'm a Machine Learning (ML)/Deep Learning (DL) Engineer and a Physicist.

- 🌱 My current interest is MLOps and filling the production gap in ML applications. I have experienced the frustration of getting models to production and maintaining them, the problems inspire my curiosity in production ML systems and how to better design them.

- ✏️ I also write about my learning and experience. Check it out in [My Website](https://tintn.github.io/posts/) or [My Medium](https://medium.com/@tintn03)

To know more about me:

Want to have a chat?
- I'm always open for interesting conversations. If you are interested in MLOps or machine learning in general, feel free to get in touch!
